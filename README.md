# SAGE_PromoterLibrary
This code is largely sourced from [DRAFTS] (https://github.com/ssyim/DRAFTS) with modifications adapted to accept nucleotide sequence and Illumina read length differences for the workflows required to process DNA and RNA barcode counts related to **S**erine-recombinase **A**ssisted **G**enome **E**ngineering (SAGE). This code is in Python.

Once barcode counts and normalized expression levels were generated, we generated R scripts to create statistical analyses of promoter expression levels and to visualize the data.
